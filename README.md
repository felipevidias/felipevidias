# 👩🏻‍💻 Felipe Dias 

**`Cybersecurity Enthusiast`**

Hi! I'm Felipe Dias, a 21-year-old Computer Science student at PUC Minas, Brazil. Since my first semester, I’ve been passionate about solving complex problems and understanding how technology really works under the hood.

My main interests include Cybersecurity, Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. I love diving deep into topics like ethical hacking, penetration testing, algorithm optimization, and data-driven applications.

I’ve worked on projects involving web development, AI with Python, advanced data structures in Java, and low-level programming like Assembly. I'm also currently a teaching assistant (monitor) for Algorithms and Data Structures, helping other students strengthen their programming and problem-solving skills.

In my free time, I like challenging myself with CTFs, personal coding projects, and exploring new areas like machine learning, network security, and database systems. I’m always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and contribute to tech communities.

My goal is to work on projects that mix software engineering, security, and research, while constantly evolving as a developer and as a learner.
